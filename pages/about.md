## About the Collection

The African American Women Writers Collection honors the voices of Black women authors whose works explore identity, resilience, and justice. 

- This collection showcases their literary contributions and lasting cultural impact through poetry, prose, and historical writings.
- Their words continue to inspire generations, empowering readers to reflect, resist, and reimagine the world around them.

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
